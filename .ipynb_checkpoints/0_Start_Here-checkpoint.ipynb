    "## Workshop Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop you will combine a few different NLP techniques to classify tweets. You will:\n",
    "- clean up your input data\n",
    "- transform your text data into numerical vectors (because machine learning algorithms need numbers as inputs!)\n",
    "- use those vectors as input to machine learning classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "We will present you with the code for three different **word embeddings** (i.e. ways to turn text into vectors of numbers) and two different **classification algorithms**. It will be your job to select an embedding and a model, train it with the data provided (you might want to perform some additional **cleansing** of the data beforehand) and then test the accuracy of your trained model. The team with the most accurate model wins!"

    "### Our Dataset: Disasters on social media\n",
    "Contributors looked at over 10,000 tweets retrieved with a variety of searches like “ablaze”, “quarantine”, and “pandemonium”, then noted whether the tweet referred to a disaster event (as opposed to a joke with the word or a movie review or something non-disastrous). Thank you [Crowdflower](https://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone/).\n",

    "We will try to correctly predict tweets that are about disasters. This is a very relevant problem, because:\n",
    "- It is actionable to anybody trying to get signal from noise (such as police departments in this case)\n",
    "- It is tricky because relying on keywords is harder than in most cases like spam\n",
    "- An analagous problem in finance is analyzing sentiment on news stories about companies."
